# Contests

These are various programming contests that I've solved. When I can, I try to
solve these in C, but if it requires something like a set, I'll go for C++
in most situations, since a proper set implementation takes a lot of code,
and C++ has builtin versions.

#### Nice ones.

+ 1003 - Parity
  + First time I have heard of or used a DSU. Slick way of solving the problem.
+ 1005 - Stone Pile
  + I read a reasearch paper on two-way partitioning to solve it.
+ 1015 - Test The Difference!
  + I really like how I do the rotation of the dice here and how I kind of
  hand unrolled the loop.
+ 1016 - Cube on the Walk
  + Nice implementation of A*
+ 1019 - Line painting
  + I implemented the damn datastructure myself, and I'm proud of it.
+ 1028 - Stars
  + First time I heard of Binary Index Tree. Cool datastructure.
+ 1032 - Find a Multiple
  + It has a nice mathematical proof behind it.
+ 1034 - Queens in Peaceful Positions
  + I rank high on this one, and it is a problem that seems impossible when
  starting, but turns out to be very possible.
+ 1074 - Very Short problem
  + I like that I managed to implement it in C, and using so little memory.
+ 1100 - Final Standings
  + First time I heard of counting sort.
+ 1185 - Wall
  + First time I encountered convex hull algorithms.
+ 1401 - Nikifor
  + It's fun when linear algebra AND modular arithmetic comes into play.
+ 1042 - Central Heating
  + I like it when linear algebra comes into places you would not expect it!


## TODO

+ Make sure to understand everything about timus 1004
+ Refine p1074, to use less structures.
+ Redo Timus p1006 to not use stretch buffers.
+ Redo Timus p1037 to be faster. This may involve queues?
