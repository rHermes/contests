 * This is an interesting challenge.
 *
 * The target k, must be odd, and you can get j from k, by doing
 *
 * j = (k+1)/2
 *
 *
 * I want to solve this with a bruteforce first, and then after that
 * we can try to get clever.
 *
 * I think it is possible, that we never move one of the points.
 * I do not know this for sure, but if it is so, then we can try
 * to use this as a baseline for generating all possible solutions
 * and test. It might even be fast enough to generate all solutions.
 *
 * There might also be a solution to this involving recursion in a 
 * way. I do not yet know. Maybe partial sums?
