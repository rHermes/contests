## What

This is a large russian archive of programming problems.

## Why

It offers some good problems and a nice visual overview. The english might
not always be the best, but the tasks are fun.


## Pitfalls

They are mean about input. Always assume that there can be extra spaces
and newlines anywhere.

They are running these solutions on 32bit machines. Make sure to learn how
to get around this if you are programming in a language like C or C++. For
C this is solved by using the PRIuX and SCNuX macros from <inttypes.h> when
scanning or printing.

The timings on each solution also warries by when you submit it. Submitting
multiple times might yield a 0.001 result from a 0.015 one.
