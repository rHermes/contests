/*
 *  p. 1009 - K-based Numbers
 *
 * I think this can be done recursively, with a function call like:
 *
 * possible(prev_zero, K, left)
 *
 * and then we can just cache that. The first call will just be:
 * possible(true, K, N)
 *
 * Even better, the formula for this is: ans[n]Â = (ans[n-1] + ans[n-2]) * (K-1)
 *
 * The reason for this is the fact that the first character can only be (K-1)
 * things, since it cant be 0. ans[n-1] is obvious, because for each of the
 * prefixes, we can have that many variations, and finally we add ans[n-2],
 * because ans[n-1] doesn't contain the possibility of a 0 prefix.
